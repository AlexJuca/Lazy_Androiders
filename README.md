#Lazy Androiders

## Introduction

Lazy Androiders is a tool that downloads and sets ups the android tools for you. No need to waste time setting up tools. Go the lazy route!

# What does it really install for you?

Lazy Androiders installs eclipse and the jdk if you don't have them and downloads the android sdk or ADT Bundle for you too. It's sometimes a hassle to do all this yourself. Right? 

## How to Use

Please make sure you are running Python3.4 or higher

Simply download the zip file, cd into the lazy_androiders directory and execute the python script like such:

eg. sudo python3.4 lazy_androiders.py

**Note: If you cancel the process the downloaded files will be cleaned up and removed from your machine.**

Unfortunately it does not show progress yet :(.
