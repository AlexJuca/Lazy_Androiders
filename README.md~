Lazy Androiders is a tool that downloads and sets ups the android tools for you. No need to waste time setting up tools. Go the lazy route!

This is the test branch for windows! 
Added slight support for windows

Lazy Android fetches the android tools sdk or ADT depending on your preferences, installs eclipse and installs the JVM if you don't already have them in your system. 

Please be aware that the tool does not currently work for Windows systems.

make sure you are running python3 or higher

Usage: sudo python3.4 lazy_androiders.py

Note: If you cancel the process the downloaded files will be cleaned up and removed from your machine.

Unfortunately it does not show progress yet :(.
